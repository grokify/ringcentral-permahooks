This is a small app that turns RingCentral's expiring outbound webhooks into non-expiring webhooks. This is especially useful when connecting to a service with a simple inbound webhook implementation such as Zapier and chat solutions like [Glip](https://glip.com). Benefits include:

* Seamlessly links RingCentral Outbound Webhooks with Inbound Webhooks offered by Zapier, Glip and others.

This is useful because RingCentral's webhook implementation has a couple of features that are not supported by all webhook consuming services. Both of the below are handled automatically by this service.

* RingCentral requires the webhook endpoint return the request `Validation-Token` header in the response to indicate the receiving endpoint is the correct one.
* RingCentral webhooks expire to ensure the correct site is receiving the information.

Deployment options:

* Run locally: only the `main.go` file is necessary as shown below.
* Lambda: TBD, will use [aws/aws-lambda-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go) like [Chathooks](https://github.com/grokify/chathooks)

See more information about creating RingCentral webhooks here:

* API Reference: https://developer.ringcentral.com/api-docs/latest/index.html#!#RefCreateSubscription
* Developer Guide: http://ringcentral-api-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/webhooks/

## Pre-requisites

You must have created an app on the RingCentral Developer Platform by logging into the Developer Portal:

https://developer.ringcentral.com

The app must have the following settings:

* Application Type: `Private`
* Platform Type: `Server-only (No UI)`
* OAuth Grant Types: `Refresh Access Token`, `Password flow`
* Permissions: `Read Messages`, `Webhook Subscriptions`

In the Developer Portal, your app will look like this.

## Installation and Configuration

Before you can complete the following installation procedure, you need to get a webhook URL from your downstream service. For example, a Zapier webhook URL.

```bash
$ go get github.com/grokify/ringcentral-permahooks
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/grokify/ringcentral-permahooks
$ cp sample.env .env
$ vi .env
$ go run main.go
```

After you start the service, create a webhook by calling the `/createhook` endpoint. You can also call the `/renewhook` endpoint to manually renew the webhook. For example:

```bash
# Create Webhook
$ curl -XGET 'https://12345678.ngrok.io/createhook'

# Renew Webhook
$ curl -XGET 'https://12345678.ngrok.io/renewhook'
```

Successfully calling `/createhook` will result in log entries like the following:

```bash
$ go run main.go 
INFO[0023] Creating Hook...

INFO[0025] Handling webhook...

INFO[0025] Created/renewed Webhook with Id: 11112222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888
```

### Tunneling

If your server is behind a NAT or a firewall and not accessible via the Internet, you can use a tunneling service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). In the following example, you would create a RingCentral webhook to `https://12345678.ngrok.io/webhook` which you would set as `PERMAHOOKS_INBOUND_WEBHOOK_URL` in your environment.

```bash
$ ngrok http 8080

### Heroku Support

Heroku support is under investigation. For Heroku, dependences are managed with `godep`. The following is used:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/tools/godep
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/grokify/ringcentral-permahooks
$ godep save ./...
```
